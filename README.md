# Teach Code for Good

Our main site is temporarily hosted on Github Pages until further changes.
This uses Pug, and SCSS with Bulma.

## Notes

The repository is structured as follows:

- The main code lies in the **source** branch.
- The **dist** directory in the source branch is mirrored to the **master** branch using deploy.sh
